      <h4>Tutorials: Finding sapphire ore</h4>
  <p>The first thing you need to do before entering crazy world is... Find a lot of sapphire!</p>
  <p>You'll need around 12 sapphire fragments to make eye of crazy, which will locate you to the nearest portal (Note: the portal spawn in the sky)</p>
  <p>Before mining sapphire, you'll need to prepare for yourself at least diamond pickaxe, and a lot of time too!</p>
  <p>Sapphire ores only spawn below y=-1. Unfortunately, what makes it difficult is the fact the Sapphire ore does not generating in vein, instead they only generated a limited amount of Sapphire ore blocks per chunk. (around 10 blocks)</p>
  <p>Each Sapphire ore block gives one sapphire fragments, which can be used to craft eye of crazy.</p>
  <p>Or if you are a no lifer, you can mine a lot of them and then craft the sapphire armor! (1 upgrading template and 1 sapphire ingot)</p>
  <p>TThat's the basic, now let's get started into the mining part!</p>
  <h4>Strats #1: mining in open area</h4>
  <p>Since sapphire only generated around 10 ores per chunk, it is good to mining at a big deepslate cave, since there are a lot more free area for you to find sapphire.</p>
  <p>You need:</p>
  <p>  - 1 diamond pickaxe</p>
  <p>  - a lot of torch or some night vison potion</p>
  <p>  - a lot of food since hostile mob spawn in these caves</p>
  <p>  - a better sword to kill the hostiles mob quickly</p>
  <p>  - other thing that will support you.</p>
  <h5>Mining:</h5>
  <p>When mining, you need to look up to see if there are any sapphire ore. They sometimes generated very high, if that's the case, then you'll need to pillar up and mine these. Be careful about skeleton and not dropping the ore!</p>
  <p>Once you have goten enough sapphire ore (12 is the minimum, I'd say), it's time to smell it!</p>
